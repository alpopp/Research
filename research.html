    <h1>Let's Suck at Git Together</h1>
    <h3>By: <a href="http://alpopp.com/" target="_blank">Alex Popp</a></h3>
        <p>I decided to change my research topic from responsive icons to version control a few weeks ago because I came to the realization that most employers expect some sort of knowledge about it. In fact, every job listing for a basic front-end web developer has it as a requirement. I am going to go into detail about Tower, a Git client for Macs. Git is the most popular Version Control System (VCS) available is heavily used and supported in the web design industry. </p>

        <p>Think of a version control system as a database that helps you back up your file structure and easily collaborate with others. Git, at its core, is accessed via the command line on your operating system; this can be tedious and difficult to learn on your own. A Git client, like Tower, gives users a GUI to help the visual learners and beginners alike. Git has tons of tools and support to help you along the way, whether it is tutorials in the form of blogs or repositories like GitHub (which we have all used, whether we realize it or not). </p>

        <p>Version control is important because, once mastered, it gives the developer total peace of mind; there is no way that a worse version of the product you have now can be released. And like I said before, it is a great tool to use to work on the same project, even the same file, with another developer. Git recognizes changes in your code, and will manipulate only the part of the file that you change. Therefore, your new code is added in “chunks,” so another chunk from another developer can be added at the same time. No more worrying about taking down the latest copy of your file so you won’t erase another developers work. It is important to mention that when wanting to work with another developer, you must use GitHub (don’t worry, it’s free). As young developers, it is important to sign up for GitHub because it is a great way to showcase exactly what you have been working on. If people are following you and you have some good projects, then you come off to an employer as an established developer. So there is actually a lot of social benefits to using something like version control. </p>

        <p>Now it is time to learn Git. Start off by creating an account or signing in on GitHub and creating a new “repository.” A repository is basically a new project and will hold all the files associated with it. This is what is called our “remote repository” and is much different than what we will set up next, a “local repository.” A local repository is your local files that can be manipulated using a Git client like I specified before. I like to use Tower because of its popularity within the industry, but there are other free options (such as a client within GitHub). Connect the local repository to the remote by the URL given on GitHub and placing it into the remote area on Tower. It is important to note that you have to add your username and password from your GitHub account. Also, if you are working on this project by yourself, you can surpass ever using GitHub and just use the client. It gives the same benefits and you can always connect a remote repository later if necessary. </p>

        <p>Back to the local repository. When a file is saved using any text editor desired, this file will show up in “Working Copy” in Tower. You can click it and see exactly what is in the file and all the previous versions it has associated with it. It is from there that you can revert to older files if you completely mess up when you completely mess up. These changes will automatically show up in the text editor. While working on a file and you think you come to a good stopping point, save it and go into Tower to view your working directory. It’s time to publish these changes. Click the check mark next to the desired file(s) to “stage” them. To “commit” the changes, give the commit a good subject and description and click “commit.” Documenting your commits is a good habit because your boss or coworkers will want to know exactly what you were working on all day. Once a file is committed, it no longer appears in your working copy until it is edited again. And as far as best practices for how often to commit, that is a discussion to have with your boss. It is also important to note that these commits will not show up on our remote repositories (GitHub) until the changes are “pushed.” Pushing and pulling merge your revisions into the file stored on the remote repository. And if Git ran into any problems, they will let you know about it through notifications. </p>

        <p>This is a very general overview of version control; Git can get as complex as desired. It is important to not use GitHub or Tower as a crutch, use them as a tool. Take the general knowledge you learn from playing around with test files and apply them. Learn Git on the command line. Due to its complexities, an employer might not want to spend the time training a potential employee if another candidate has the version control experience. </p>
